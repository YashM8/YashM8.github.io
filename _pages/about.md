👋🏼 I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) interested in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Optimization. I have worked as a Research Assistant (RA) applying AI to many fields. I am passionate about understanding how large neural networks work to develop safe and interpretable AI. 

I am the ML Lead for UBC [Uncrewed Aerial Systems](https://ubcuas.com/) (UAS) and the director of ML at the UBC AI club.
