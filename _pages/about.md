üëãüèº I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) interested in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Optimization. I have worked as a Research Assistant (RA) applying AI to many fields. I am passionate about understanding how large neural networks work to develop safe and interpretable AI. 

I am the ML Lead for UBC [Uncrewed Aerial Systems](https://ubcuas.com/) (UAS) and the director of ML at the UBC AI club. 

Selected Experience
------
### Automation Software Engineer  
**[Lux Bio](https://www.luxbio.ca/)**  
*September 2024 - May 2025*  

As an Automation Software Engineer at Lux Bio, I was responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining automation systems tailored to bioprocess engineering. My role involved integrating and managing communication protocols such as RS485 using Modbus, Serial, and other technologies to ensure seamless device communication and operation. This work demanded a combination of innovative problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of industrial automation systems.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant  
**[UBC Engineering at Frostad Research Group](https://food.chbe.ubc.ca/)**  
*May 2024 - September 2024*  

During my tenure as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, I led the development of bespoke software solutions for multiphasic fluid experiments. I engineered deep learning-based particle tracking software to efficiently analyze fluid behavior and engineered hardware automation systems to enhance data acquisition accuracy. By collaborating with interdisciplinary teams of researchers and engineers, I addressed unique project requirements, identified technological gaps, and delivered effective solutions that advanced the group‚Äôs research objectives.
